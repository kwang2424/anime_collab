# anime_collab

After watching fast.ai's deep learning course, wanted to try my hands at collaborative filtering in fast.ai on an anime review dataset instead of movies. Currently, the results are not amazing, partly due to the big dataset and lack of training time. Furthermore, the amount of factors could also be tweaked to adjust. 

For my next steps, I'm working on implementing in pytorch and also finding ways to determine the interpretability of latent factors (based off this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10816). 

The dataset was obtained [here](https://github.com/Hernan4444/MyAnimeList-Database).
